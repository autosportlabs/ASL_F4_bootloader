# Note that there are two special fields in each command
# _targets: this specifies which target (i.e. which end of the message pipe)
# will be responsible for generating this message.  Since this protocol was made
# with embedded targets in mind, this is important for space savings in the code
# Note that it is not necessary for all language targets to adhere to this directive
# _id: This specifies the unique message id and allows for some minor extensibility
